# Synopsis
After a breach between Earth and the Beyond opened over New York City, the city was transformed into "Hellsalem's Lot," a chaotic and bizarre realm where humans and otherworldly creatures coexist. The series follows Leonardo Watch, a young man who comes to the city seeking answers about his sister's mysterious blindness. He soon finds himself joining a secret organization called Libra, which is tasked with keeping the peace between the various factions of the city. As he navigates this insane world, he uses his unique ability, the "All-Seeing Eyes of the Gods," to help his new friends fight monsters and prevent the city from falling into complete madness.
