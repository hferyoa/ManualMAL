A wave of fear sweeps across Tokyo as a mysterious assailant known as "Lil' Slugger" (Sh≈çnen Bat) begins attacking people with a golden baseball bat and rollerblades. The victims all seem to be high-strung individuals who have found themselves in a corner, and after being attacked, they find themselves relieved of their burdens. As the attacks continue and the public's anxiety grows, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case. They soon discover that Lil' Slugger may not be a normal person, and his attacks seem to be a manifestation of the collective paranoia and stress of the city, which is spiraling out of control.
