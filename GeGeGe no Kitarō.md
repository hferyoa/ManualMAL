# Synopsis
In modern Japan, yokai (spirits of folklore) clash with humanity’s greed and corruption. Kitarou, a one-eyed yokai boy, acts as mediator and protector — often through eerie, noir-toned cases blending horror with social commentary. While aimed at a broad audience, the 2018 reboot dips into surprisingly dark territory.
