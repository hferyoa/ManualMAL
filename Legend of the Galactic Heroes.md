# Synopsis
For over 150 years, two massive interstellar nations—the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance—have been at war. The series follows the intertwined destinies of two brilliant military commanders: Reinhard von Lohengramm, a genius who rises through the ranks of the tyrannical Empire, and Yang Wen-li, a historian-turned-tactician who leads the democratic Alliance. As the conflict escalates, their genius and convictions collide, determining the fate of the entire galaxy.
