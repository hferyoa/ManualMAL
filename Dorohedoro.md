# Synopsis
Set in the grim, chaotic city of Hole, _Dorohedoro_ follows Caiman, a man with a reptilian head and amnesia, as he hunts sorcerers to discover who transformed him. Alongside his friend Nikaido, a skilled fighter and restaurant owner, Caiman navigates a bizarre world full of grotesque magic, dark humor, and violent encounters. The series blends brutal action with surreal comedy, eccentric characters, and inventive worldbuilding. While it has heavy violence and grotesque imagery, its irreverent humor, quirky cast, and fast-paced narrative give it a **Medium** tone — intense and chaotic, but not oppressively dark like traditional noir.
