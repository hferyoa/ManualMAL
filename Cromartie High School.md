# Synopsis
Takashi Kamiyama, a seemingly normal and well-mannered student, finds himself enrolled at the notorious Cromartie High Schoolâ€”a school for the toughest delinquents in all of Japan. Despite his mild-mannered appearance, his classmates assume he must be the toughest of all, based on the twisted logic that only a "rabbit" would dare to enter a "lion's den." The series is a surreal and absurd gag comedy that follows Kamiyama's attempts to navigate his new life alongside a bizarre cast of classmates, including a student with a robot body, a silent-but-deadly student who looks exactly like Freddie Mercury, and a gorilla.
