# Synopsis
Set during the Prohibition era in the town of Lawless, Illinois, the story follows Angelo Lagusa, a young man who witnessed the murder of his entire family by the Vanetti Mafia family seven years prior. After living in hiding, he returns to Lawless under the false identity of Avilio Bruno. His sole purpose is to exact revenge on the men who killed his family, and he slowly infiltrates the Vanetti crime family by befriending the don's son, Nero Vanetti. The series chronicles Avilio's brutal and calculated path of vengeance, as he pits rival families against each other and manipulates those around him, all while questioning whether revenge is truly worth the price.
