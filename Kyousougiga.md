# Synopsis
Koto, a girl searching for her missing parents, finds herself trapped in a bizarre city ruled by monk-like siblings and overrun with yokai and eccentric gods. Beneath the whimsy lies themes of abandonment, destiny, and cycles of destruction, balancing playful visuals with an undercurrent of urban mythic noir.
