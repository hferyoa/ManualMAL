# Synopsis
Ten years ago, a mysterious phenomenon created the “Hell’s Gate” in Tokyo, altering the sky and giving rise to Contractors — humans who gain supernatural powers but lose their humanity. Hei, known as the “Black Reaper,” works as a masked assassin for shadowy organizations, navigating espionage, betrayal, and moral ambiguity in a world that treats Contractors as expendable tools.
