# Synopsis
The story is set in a world where everyone possesses a unique superpower. The protagonist, a young man named Yoru, has a peculiar ability: he can only gain power by being the target of a vulgar or crude insult. Due to this unusual and humiliating condition, he has never been able to truly unleash his abilities.

The plot follows Yoru as he finds himself thrust into a high-stakes conflict within the "Hero Union," an organization that monitors and controls those with superpowers. As he navigates this dangerous world and attempts to overcome the psychological limitations of his power, he must decide whether to be a hero or a villain.
