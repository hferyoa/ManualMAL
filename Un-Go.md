# Synopsis
In a near-future Japan recovering from war, detective Shinjūrō Yuuki — nicknamed the “Defeated Detective” — solves crimes with the help of Inga, a supernatural companion with the power to extract a single truth from anyone. Noir mysteries that dissect propaganda, truth, and the manipulation of narrative itself.
