The story is set in a bustling metropolis called Russell City. The main character, a powerful Makai Knight named Sword, is on a mission to hunt down a sinister plot involving an organization called the "El Dorado" that is responsible for creating powerful demons called "Horrors." He is accompanied by a young girl named Sophie, who is searching for her missing older brother, a man who left her with a single message: "El Dorado." The duo must confront dangerous Horrors and uncover the truth behind the mysterious phrase, all while fighting to protect humanity from the darkness lurking in the city's shadows.
