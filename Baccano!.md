# Synopsis
Set across the Prohibition era in America, gangsters, alchemists, and immortals collide in a bloody, non-linear story. The Flying Pussyfoot train massacre, a stolen immortality elixir, and dozens of morally grey characters all weave together in overlapping tales of violence and chaos. Think Tarantino meets supernatural mafia noir.
