# Synopsis
The story follows a young detective named Kohachi Inugami who specializes in cases involving supernatural creatures called "kemono." He is called to a remote village to investigate a series of incidents involving animal carcasses. There, he meets a quiet boy named Kabane Kusaka, who is ostracized by his peers and referred to as "Dorotabō." Inugami discovers that Kabane is a half-human, half-ghoul creature and has a powerful ability. The two form an unlikely partnership, with Inugami recruiting Kabane and other young kemono to help him solve various mysteries related to their hidden world.
