# Synopsis
Set in post-World War II Japan, the story begins with a series of brutal dismemberment murders. The investigation is led by two detectives and a novelist, who are all connected to a seemingly unrelated disappearance case involving a young girl. The central mystery revolves around a strange, seemingly immortal doctor who runs a laboratory that researches artificial limbs and his connection to the murdered girls. As the characters delve deeper into the twisted plot, they uncover a horrifying conspiracy that connects the murders to a bizarre cult, a box filled with human remains, and the monstrous nature of human obsession.
