# Synopsis
In a mysterious bar that exists beyond life, recently deceased souls are judged through elaborate games that reveal their true natures. The bartender, Decim, oversees these games, determining whether souls are reincarnated or sent to the void. Each episode focuses on different characters, exploring themes of regret, morality, and the complexities of human emotion. While some stories are tragic, the series balances them with clever storytelling, philosophical musings, and moments of levity or hope, giving it emotional weight without being relentlessly heavy.
