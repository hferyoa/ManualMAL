# Synopsis
_Clannad_ follows Tomoya Okazaki, a disenchanted high school delinquent, who encounters the strange but kind Nagisa Furukawa and a cast of classmates each carrying their own emotional burdens. Initially a slice-of-life and lightly comedic story about friendship and school life, the series gradually unfolds into a deeply emotional drama that explores family, loss, love, and the choices that shape one’s life. The sequel _Clannad: After Story_ especially amplifies the weight, delivering gut-punching tragedy and heartfelt moments that linger long after the final episode. It’s a slow-burn, character-driven experience that balances lighthearted school life with profoundly heavy themes.
