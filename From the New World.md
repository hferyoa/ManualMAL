# Synopsis
Set 1,000 years in the future, humanity has evolved psychic powers, but society is tightly controlled to prevent the misuse of these abilities. The story follows Saki Watanabe and her friends as they grow up in this seemingly idyllic world, only to uncover dark truths about their society, the rigid caste system, and the violent history that shaped it. Blending dystopian worldbuilding, psychological tension, and moral ambiguity, _From the New World_ explores the corruption of innocence, the ethics of power, and the cost of survival in a controlled society.
