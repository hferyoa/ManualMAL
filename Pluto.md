# Synopsis
Set in a futuristic world where highly advanced robots coexist with humans, _Pluto_ follows the story of Europol detective Gesicht, a powerful robot tasked with solving a series of murders targeting both robots and humans. The victims are the world's seven most advanced robots and the humans who created them. As the investigation unfolds, Gesicht discovers a chilling truth: the murders are linked to the 39th Central Asian War and a powerful being with an unknown motive. The series explores themes of prejudice, artificial intelligence, and what it truly means to be a living being as Gesicht races against time to stop the killer known only as Pluto.
