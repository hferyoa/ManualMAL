# Synopsis
The story follows Fuuko Izumo, a young woman who possesses the ability of "Unluck." Anyone who touches her is instantly cursed with extreme misfortune, leading to a life of self-isolation. When she decides to end her life, she is stopped by Andy, a seemingly immortal man with the ability of "Undead," who cannot die no matter how much he is dismembered. Recognizing that her unluck is the only thing that can truly kill him, Andy makes a deal with Fuuko: he will use her unluck to find a way to truly die, while she becomes his partner in his quest to join a mysterious organization called the Union.
