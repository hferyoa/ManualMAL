# Synopsis
Set in the early 20th century, the story follows Saichi "Immortal" Sugimoto, a veteran of the Russo-Japanese War, who is now a gold prospector in Hokkaido. He teams up with an Ainu girl named Asirpa, whose father was killed while searching for a hidden Ainu gold stash. The gold's location is a secret tattooed on the bodies of several escaped prisoners. Together, they embark on a brutal journey to find the gold before anyone else.
