# Synopsis
Certain gifted individuals can enter and manipulate the memories of others, reshaping trauma and thoughts like clay. These “Pets” are used by a crime syndicate to erase evidence and control targets. But tampering with minds comes at a cost, as fragile identities unravel and the line between controller and controlled blurs into paranoia and despair.
