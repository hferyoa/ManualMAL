# Synopsis
The story centers on Naota Nandaba, a 12-year-old boy living a mundane life in his boring hometown. His life is turned upside down when a pink-haired woman named Haruko Haruhara crashes into him on her Vespa scooter, hitting him with a guitar. The blow to his head causes a bizarre horn to sprout from his forehead, which becomes a portal through which giant robots emerge from his head. Haruko, who claims to be an investigator from the "Galactic Space Patrol," decides to live with Naota and his family, leading to a series of chaotic and surreal events that force Naota to confront the absurdity of his life and the anxieties of growing up.
