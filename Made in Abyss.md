# Synopsis
The Abyss is a colossal, unexplored chasm in the center of a mysterious island. It is the last great frontier, filled with fantastical creatures and ancient relics. The story follows Riko, a young orphan girl who dreams of becoming a legendary "Cave Raider" like her mother. One day, she discovers a robot boy named Reg and, with him, she decides to embark on a dangerous journey to the bottom of the Abyss to find her mother.
