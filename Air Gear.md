# Synopsis
The story follows Itsuki "Ikki" Minami, a high school delinquent and leader of a gang known as the "East Side Gunz." After being defeated by a rival gang using powerful, motorized roller skates called "Air Treks," Ikki discovers a pair of his own and enters the high-octane world of "Storm Riders." He quickly forms his own team and begins to climb the ranks, challenging rival teams and facing off against powerful riders who dominate the underground. The series is a fast-paced blend of action, sports, and comedy as Ikki and his friends chase their dreams of becoming the best riders on the road.
