# Synopsis
The story takes place in the fictional rural village of Hinamizawa, in 1983. Keiichi Maebara, a transfer student from the city, quickly befriends a group of cheerful girls at his new school. However, as the annual Watanagashi Festival approaches, Keiichi learns about the village's dark history of gruesome murders and disappearances that have occurred on the day of the festival for the past four years. As he delves deeper into the village's secrets, he begins to feel that his friends are hiding something from him, and a paranoia sets in, leading to a series of psychological horror scenarios that repeat across different story arcs, revealing different facets of the underlying conspiracy.
