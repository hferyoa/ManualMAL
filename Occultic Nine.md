# Synopsis
The story follows nine eccentric individuals who are all linked to a mysterious blog about the paranormal. These include Yuta Gamon, an occult-obsessed blogger; Ryotasun, his friend and a part-timer at a local manga shop; and a group of others with varying beliefs about the supernatural. Their lives become intertwined after a mysterious mass suicide occurs in a local park. As the group investigates the incident, they discover a shocking truth: they are all already dead and exist as ghosts in the world. They must now solve the mystery of their deaths and the strange events surrounding them before they are erased from existence forever.
