# Synopsis
Denji is a destitute teenager saddled with crushing debt, who finds brief companionship in his pet devil-dog Pochita. After being betrayed and slaughtered by the yakuza, Denji is resurrected as _Chainsaw Man_ — a hybrid human-devil who sprouts chainsaws from his arms and head. Drafted into Public Safety to hunt other devils, Denji battles grotesque enemies while grappling with his own humanity, desire, and trauma. The series mixes ultraviolent carnage, black comedy, and heartbreaking vulnerability, exploring themes of exploitation, free will, and the cost of survival in a world that chews people up and spits them out.
