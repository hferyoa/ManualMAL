# Synopsis
Juri Yukawa, an unemployed young woman, is struggling to find her place in a family that seems to be falling apart. When her brother and nephew are kidnapped and a ransom is demanded, her grandfather reveals a hidden family secret: a mysterious stone that can stop time, allowing them to enter a world called "Stasis." As they venture into this frozen world to rescue their family, they discover they are not alone. They must contend with a sinister cult that can also move through Stasis, as well as grotesque monsters known as "Handlers" that protect the "stalled" people. Juri and her family must race against time to save their loved ones and uncover the secrets of the stone and Stasis itself.
