# Synopsis
The story takes place in 1999, as the end of the world is rapidly approaching. The fate of humanity rests in the hands of Kamui Shiro, a powerful young man who has returned to Tokyo after a six-year absence. He is caught between two opposing factions: the "Dragons of Heaven," who are prophesied to save humanity by protecting the Earth, and the "Dragons of Earth," who believe humanity must be wiped out to give the planet a clean slate. Kamui must choose his destiny and lead one of the factions in a final battle that will decide the fate of all life on Earth.
