# Synopsis
In a dystopian future of Kansai, a group of highly skilled criminals known as "Akudama" are brought together by an anonymous client for a seemingly impossible task: to break into a high-security prison and save a notorious mass murderer. The group, which includes a brawling thug, a charming courier, a mad doctor, a master hacker, and a young woman who accidentally got roped into the job, finds themselves in an increasingly chaotic and violent situation. As they complete their mission, they discover a conspiracy that threatens to unravel their world, and they must either trust each other or face certain death.
