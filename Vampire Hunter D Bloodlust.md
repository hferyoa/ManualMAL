# Synopsis
The story takes place in the distant future, where vampires still exist and humanity is struggling to recover from their oppressive reign. The legendary dhampir (half-vampire, half-human) hunter, D, is hired by a wealthy family to rescue their daughter, Charlotte, who has been abducted by the powerful vampire Lord Meier Link. The family's other bounty hunter group, the Markus Brothers, are also on the case, creating a rivalry with D. As D and the Markus Brothers pursue Meier Link and Charlotte across a desolate, monster-filled landscape, D begins to suspect that Charlotte may have gone with the vampire willingly, and the true motive behind the abduction is not what it seems.
