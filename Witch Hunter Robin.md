# Synopsis
In a world where witchcraft exists, the STN-J organization secretly hunts and contains witches who threaten society. Robin, a young craft user herself, is transferred to Japan to assist the team — but her mysterious powers, and the organization’s hidden motives, make her question who the real “witches” are. A brooding, cigarette-smoke-stained supernatural noir.
