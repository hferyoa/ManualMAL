# Synopsis
The story follows Hiroshi Odokawa, a 41-year-old walrus who drives a taxi for a living. His life is mundane and predictable, but his seemingly insignificant conversations with his passengers slowly begin to weave together into a much larger mystery. When a high-profile case about a missing girl from a few months ago becomes connected to his cab, Odokawa finds himself at the centre of a dark and complex conspiracy.
