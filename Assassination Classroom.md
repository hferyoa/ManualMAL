# Synopsis
The students of Class 3-E, the most neglected and lowest-ranked class at Kunugigaoka Junior High, are given an impossible task: to assassinate their teacher before the school year ends. Their teacher, a powerful octopus-like creature known as Koro-sensei, destroyed 70% of the moon and threatens to destroy the Earth in one year. Despite his destructive nature, Koro-sensei is a brilliant and kind-hearted teacher who genuinely wants his students to succeed. The series follows the students' various attempts to kill their teacher, all while learning valuable life lessons and improving their grades under his unconventional guidance.
