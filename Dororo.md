# Synopsis
In a war-torn Sengoku-era Japan, Hyakkimaru is born missing 48 body parts, sacrificed by his father to demons in exchange for power and prosperity. Abandoned by his family, he grows up fighting demons to reclaim his stolen body parts, accompanied by the young orphan thief Dororo. The series combines dark, supernatural action with emotional character arcs, exploring themes of identity, revenge, and humanity. While the tone can be grim and violent, Dororoâ€™s bond with his companion and moments of levity balance the narrative, making it **Medium** rather than crushingly heavy.
