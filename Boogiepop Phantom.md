# Synopsis
A surreal, fragmented urban horror series, _Boogiepop Phantom_ explores the lingering aftermath of a mysterious pillar of light that appeared in the city one night. Strange phenomena begin occurring—memories distort, people vanish, and supernatural forces prey on human weakness. Each episode shifts perspective, weaving together multiple characters’ experiences in nonlinear fashion. At the heart of it is the enigmatic figure Boogiepop, an urban legend said to appear when the world is on the brink of disaster. With its eerie atmosphere, unsettling imagery, and psychological weight, this anime leans more toward existential dread than straightforward storytelling, demanding the viewer to piece its puzzle together.
