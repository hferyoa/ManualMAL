# Synopsis
n 19th-century Paris, a city caught between gothic beauty and lurking menace, vampire society is shaken by a curse that drives its victims into bloodthirsty frenzy. Enter Vanitas, a flamboyant and unorthodox human doctor who wields the mysterious _Book of Vanitas_, said to have been written by the infamous “Blue Moon Vampire.” Alongside Noé Archiviste, a curious and idealistic vampire, Vanitas sets out to cure the afflicted while uncovering the tangled conspiracies that bind humans, vampires, and ancient curses together. Balancing gothic mystery, sharp banter, and moments of emotional depth, the series blends lighthearted character dynamics with darker undercurrents of tragedy, betrayal, and identity.
