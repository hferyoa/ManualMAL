# Synopsis
In a post-apocalyptic world overrun by monstrous Gadoll, humanity survives in massive mobile fortresses called Deca-Dence. The story follows Natsume, a spirited young girl who dreams of fighting Gadoll despite being physically weak, and Kaburagi, a jaded maintenance worker with a mysterious past. Together, they uncover hidden truths about their world while participating in fast-paced battles and high-stakes missions. Though it has dramatic stakes and action, the series leans into humor, adventurous energy, and hopeful character arcs, making it an easy, entertaining watch.
