# Synopsis
The story is set in a vast, multi-leveled, ever-expanding mechanical structure known as "The City," which has grown uncontrollably, reaching the size of a solar system. The protagonist, a silent wanderer named Killy, roams through this dangerous labyrinth. His mission is to find a "Net Terminal Gene," a key genetic marker that would allow humans to connect to the City's governing system, the Netsphere, and stop the monstrous, rogue robots and machines known as Safeguard from exterminating them.
