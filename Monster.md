# Synopsis
Dr. Kenzo Tenma, a brilliant Japanese neurosurgeon working in Germany, is on the verge of a promotion when he makes a moral choice to save the life of a young boy over that of the city's mayor. This decision costs him his career, but nine years later, he discovers that the boy he saved has grown up to be a cold-blooded killer. Tenma feels a moral obligation to find and stop the monster he brought back to life, leading him on a desperate journey across Europe.
