# Synopsis
The story follows Staz Charlie Blood, a powerful vampire boss of a demonic territory who is more interested in Japanese manga, anime, and video games than drinking blood. His life takes an unexpected turn when a young human girl, Fuyumi Yanagi, accidentally wanders into his territory and is immediately devoured by a monster. Shocked that Fuyumi has become a ghost, Staz sets out on a quest to revive her, believing it's his only chance to meet a real-life human. His journey takes him all over the demon world, where he must fight powerful rivals and navigate bizarre situations to bring Fuyumi back to life.
