# Synopsis
Set in a bleak near-future where Earth has been overrun by alien insectoid creatures known as the _Blue_, humanity has fled to space colonies and left the planet behind. The story follows Yuji Kaido, a young man suffering from a rare disease, who wakes from cryogenic sleep years later to find Earth devastated. Rescued by a military group called the Sleeper Recovery Team, Yuji is dragged into a brutal survival struggle where the line between human and monster begins to blur. _Blue Gender_ is a mix of body horror, mecha action, and tragic romance, with a grim tone that emphasizes humanityâ€™s desperation and fragility.
