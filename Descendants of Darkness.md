# Synopsis
The story follows a young shinigami (death god) named Tsuzuki Asato, who works for the Juuohcho, the supernatural version of a police force that investigates crimes committed by supernatural beings and against the laws of the afterlife. Tsuzuki is a laid-back, kind-hearted individual, but he is tormented by a dark past. He is partnered with Hisoka Kurosaki, a serious and reserved teenager who died at a young age and is now his junior partner. The duo solves a series of gruesome and bizarre cases, delving into the mysteries of the human and spirit worlds while confronting the powerful, sociopathic Dr. Muraki, a man who is obsessed with Tsuzuki and seeks to harm him.
