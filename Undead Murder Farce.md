# Synopsis
Set in the 19th century, the story follows the "cage user" Tsugaru Shinuchi, a half-human, half-oni man who possesses immense strength and regenerative abilities. He travels through Europe alongside a mysterious, disembodied head named Aya Rindou, who is a brilliant detective in search of her body and the man who stole it. The duo, with the help of their maid Shizuku Hasei, embark on a journey to solve supernatural mysteries and crimes involving mythical creatures and supernatural beings, all while closing in on the secrets of Aya's stolen body.
