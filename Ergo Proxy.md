# Synopsis
In a post-apocalyptic future where humans coexist with androids called AutoReivs, inspector Re-l Mayer investigates a series of murders linked to mysterious beings known as Proxies. As she uncovers the truth, she and the fugitive Vincent Law embark on a journey through desolate cities, confronting questions of identity, consciousness, and the nature of humanity. With philosophical undertones, psychological tension, and a brooding cyberpunk aesthetic, _Ergo Proxy_ is slow-burning, cerebral, and emotionally weighty, making it a **Heavy** series.
