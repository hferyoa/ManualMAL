# Synopsis
The story is set in a secluded and tranquil Japanese village named Sotoba. A series of mysterious and sudden deaths begins to plague the village, coinciding with the arrival of the strange Kirishiki family who move into a Western-style mansion. As the deaths increase, the village's only doctor, Toshio Ozaki, begins to suspect a supernatural cause. His investigation leads him to the terrifying realization that the village is being attacked by "shiki," or vampires, who are systematically preying on the inhabitants. The series explores the chilling descent of the village into paranoia, with a shifting perspective that questions the morality of both the living and the undead in their fight for survival.
