# Synopsis
The enigmatic Medicine Seller travels across feudal Japan, exorcising Mononoke — malevolent spirits born from human emotion — but he can only banish them by learning their Form, Truth, and Reason. Each case unfolds as a stylized, chilling supernatural mystery, drenched in ukiyo-e-inspired visuals and oppressive noir atmosphere.
