# Synopsis
Sousuke Sagara, a skilled mercenary from a covert military organization, is assigned to protect high school student Kaname Chidori from mysterious threats. To blend in, he must navigate everyday school life, which proves hilariously difficult due to his over-the-top military mindset. The series blends mecha action with comedy, often contrasting intense battle sequences with the absurdity of Sousuke’s attempts at normal teenage life.
