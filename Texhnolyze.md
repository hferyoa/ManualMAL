# Synopsis
The story takes place in the decaying underground city of Lukuss. Society is built on a technology called "texhnolyze," which allows for the mechanical replacement of body parts. Ichise, a prize-fighter who loses an arm and a leg, is given new texhnolyzed limbs and finds himself caught in a war between three powerful factions vying for control of the city. He is visited by Ran, a young girl with the ability to see into the future, who warns him of a looming catastrophe. The series follows Ichise's brutal journey through the city's grim reality, exploring themes of human nature, destiny, and the dark consequences of technological advancement.
