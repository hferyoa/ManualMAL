# Synopsis
In a futuristic, feudal Japan, a samurai's life is defined by the headbands he wears. The Number One headband grants the wearer godlike power and immortality, but only the Number Two can challenge them. The Number Two can only be challenged by anyone. The story follows Afro, a skilled swordsman who witnessed his father, the previous Number One, be brutally murdered by the new Number One, a man named Justice. As an adult, Afro has grown into the Number Two, and he embarks on a bloody quest for revenge, fighting countless opponents who seek his headband and facing his own internal demons.
