# Synopsis
Set in a small, isolated town in the mountains of Japan, the story follows three teenage boys who have all experienced a traumatic event in their childhoods. Taro Komori was kidnapped as a child; Makoto Ogami witnessed his sister's suicide; and Masayuki Nakajima was bullied relentlessly. They discover they can leave their physical bodies as "astral projections" and travel into a spiritual realm called the "Unseen World" during their sleep. In this alternate dimension, they must confront their past traumas and investigate the mysterious supernatural phenomena occurring in their town. As they dig deeper, they uncover a dark conspiracy related to a local biotechnology research facility and a frightening secret that links all three of their pasts.
