# Synopsis
Set in the Edo period of Japan, the story follows a young writer named Momosuke Yamaoka. He is writing a book called _Hyakumonogatari_ (One Hundred Ghost Stories) and travels through the country, seeking out tales of the bizarre and supernatural. Along his journey, he encounters a mysterious trio of individuals known as the "Ongyou." This group investigates and exposes the truth behind supernatural legends, often revealing that the "monsters" are simply corrupt humans. Momosuke joins them, becoming a witness to their dark work as they exact a brutal and supernatural form of justice on those who commit heinous crimes in the guise of folklore.
