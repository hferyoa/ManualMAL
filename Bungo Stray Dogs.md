# Synopsis
_Bungo Stray Dogs_ follows Atsushi Nakajima, an orphan with the mysterious ability to transform into a white tiger under the moonlight. After being cast out of his orphanage, he encounters the eccentric detective Osamu Dazai and becomes involved with the Armed Detective Agency, an organization of ability users who tackle cases too dangerous for the police. Standing against them are the Port Mafia and other powerful factions, creating a turbulent mix of crime, supernatural powers, and political intrigue. Each character is based on a famous literary figure, with their powers reflecting their works. While it has its share of humor and lighthearted team dynamics, its core themes deal with trauma, morality, and the weight of past sins—making it a stylish mix of noir action and supernatural drama.
